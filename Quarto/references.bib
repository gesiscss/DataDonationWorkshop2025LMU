	abstract = {Research dealing with various aspects of the theory of planned behavior (Ajzen, 1985, Ajzen, 1987) is reviewed, and some unresolved issues are discussed. In broad terms, the theory is found to be well supported by empirical evidence. Intentions to perform behaviors of different kinds can be predicted with high accuracy from attitudes toward the behavior, subjective norms, and perceived behavioral control; and these intentions, together with perceptions of behavioral control, account for considerable variance in actual behavior. Attitudes, subjective norms, and perceived behavioral control are shown to be related to appropriate sets of salient behavioral, normative, and control beliefs about the behavior, but the exact nature of these relations is still uncertain. Expectancy-value formulations are found to be only partly successful in dealing with these relations. Optimal rescaling of expectancy and value measures is offered as a means of dealing with measurement limitations. Finally, inclusion of past behavior in the prediction equation is shown to provide a means of testing the theory's sufficiency, another issue that remains unresolved. The limited available evidence concerning this question shows that the theory is predicting behavior quite well in comparison to the ceiling imposed by behavioral reliability.},

   abstract = " Digital trace data retrieved via data donations holds significant potential for the study of individual behavior. However, data donation studies may be subject to bias. Researchers therefore need to quantify and address systematic error in digital trace data. To complement a-posteriori error correction methods like statistical modeling, we tested how ex-ante approaches, in particular survey design strategies, may help address bias in data donation studies. We conducted two preregistered experiments, one with a convenience sample of students (N&lt;sub&gt;I&lt;/sub&gt; = 345) and one with a convenience sample from an online access panel (N&lt;sub&gt;II&lt;/sub&gt; = 2,039). In both experiments, we analyzed the effects of survey design strategies – technical support during data donation, personalized incentives, and highlighting the societal relevance of participants’ data – on nonresponse rates and nonresponse bias. Our results indicate that while data donation studies are prone to both, our ex-ante strategies could not effectively decrease nonresponse rates or nonresponse bias. Overall, our study underlines the need to (a) make bias in digital trace data more transparent and (b) advance research on error correction methods. ",
